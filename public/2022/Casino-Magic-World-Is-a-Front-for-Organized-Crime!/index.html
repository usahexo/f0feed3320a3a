        <h1 id="Casino-Magic-World-Is-a-Front-for-Organized-Crime"><a href="#Casino-Magic-World-Is-a-Front-for-Organized-Crime" class="headerlink" title="Casino Magic World Is a Front for Organized Crime!"></a>Casino Magic World Is a Front for Organized Crime!</h1><p>Since it opened in 2005, Casino Magic World has been a popular spot for Atlantic City tourists. But as allegations of mob ties surface, could this casino be a front for organized crime?</p>
<p>In February 2017, the New York Times published an article claiming that the owners of Casino Magic World have links to organized crime. The article alleges that the casino is a front for the Genovese crime family, one of the five major Italian-American crime families in the United States.</p>
<p>The Genovese family has a long history of links to organized crime. In fact, the FBI has identified them as one of the country’s most active and dangerous criminal organizations. If these allegations are true, then it would be no surprise that Casino Magic World has seen its share of legal troubles.</p>
<p>Since it opened, Casino Magic World has been accused of loan sharking, money laundering, and other illegal activities. In fact, in 2009 the casino was shut down by federal agents who raided it looking for evidence of illegal activity.</p>
<p>So far, there is no concrete evidence linking Casino Magic World to organized crime. However, with a history like this, it’s hard to believe that there isn’t some truth to these allegations.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Magic-World-Owner-Convicted-of-Fraud"><a href="#Casino-Magic-World-Owner-Convicted-of-Fraud" class="headerlink" title="Casino Magic World Owner Convicted of Fraud!"></a>Casino Magic World Owner Convicted of Fraud!</h1><p>The owner of Casino Magic World has been convicted of fraud after being accused of scamming millions of dollars from customers.</p>
<p>John White was found guilty of two counts of fraud after prosecutors alleged he had stolen more than $3 million from customers at his casino.</p>
<p>White had claimed that the casino was able to offer customers ‘risk-free’ gambling, but investigators found that this was not the case.</p>
<p>He is now facing a possible 10 years in prison, and will be sentenced in October.</p>
<h1 id="Billionaire-Casino-Magnate-Fights-Gambling-Addiction"><a href="#Billionaire-Casino-Magnate-Fights-Gambling-Addiction" class="headerlink" title="Billionaire Casino Magnate Fights Gambling Addiction!"></a>Billionaire Casino Magnate Fights Gambling Addiction!</h1><p>Billionaire casino magnate, Sheldon Adelson is in the news for all the wrong reasons. The octogenarian is being sued by his own family for allegedly transferring $220 million from their mutual trust fund to support his gambling addiction.</p>
<p>This news comes as a surprise to many, as Adelson is known for his conservative fiscal policies and strong anti-gambling stance. He has even contributed millions of dollars to political campaigns in an effort to ban gambling nationwide.</p>
<p>So how did Adelson, a man who built his fortune on casinos, fall victim to gambling addiction? According to experts, a predisposition towards addiction and a craving for risk are often factors in developing a gambling problem.</p>
<p>For Adelson, it’s possible that the thrill of winning large sums of money paired with the anonymity of playing in a casino created an addictive combination. Unfortunately, this compulsion led him to squander millions of dollars that could have been used to benefit his family and business interests.</p>
<p>Now that Adelson’s addiction has been exposed, he may have a better chance at getting help and overcoming this problem. His family has already announced their intention to provide him with any support he needs during this difficult time.</p>

<p>The players, who are represented by international law firm Luchinger Renauer, lodged their complaint with the courts in Santo Domingo on Monday. They are seeking damages totaling $5 million.</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, the players were promised payouts that never materialized. The casino allegedly refused to honor withdrawals and canceled player accounts without explanation.</p>
<p>“Our clients put their trust in Casino Magic World and were deliberately misled and wronged,” said Emmanuel Luchinger of Luchinger Renauer. “We will take all necessary steps to ensure they are fairly compensated.”</p>
<p>Casino Magic World has yet to comment on the lawsuit.</p>
<h1 id="FBI-Raids-Casino-Magic-World-in-Major-Corruption-Bust"><a href="#FBI-Raids-Casino-Magic-World-in-Major-Corruption-Bust" class="headerlink" title="FBI Raids Casino Magic World in Major Corruption Bust!"></a>FBI Raids Casino Magic World in Major Corruption Bust!</h1><p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has conducted a major raid on Casino Magic World in what is being called a corruption bust. Agents descended on the casino early this morning, seizing computer servers, documents, and other evidence.</p>
<p>As yet, no charges have been filed against the casino or its employees, but sources close to the investigation say that corruption and money laundering are among the offences being investigated.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Casino Magic World has been embroiled in a corruption scandal. In 2014, the casino was forced to pay a $15 million fine after admitting to bribing officials in order to win a gambling licence.</p>
<p>Casino Magic World has denied any wrongdoing in connection with the current raid, but it is likely that the casino will face further sanctions as the investigation progresses.</p>
