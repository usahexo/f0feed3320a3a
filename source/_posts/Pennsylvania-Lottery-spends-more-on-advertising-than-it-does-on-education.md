#  Pennsylvania Lottery spends more on advertising than it does on education

Pennsylvania’s lottery is unsurprisingly one of the most advertised state lotteries in the United States. In fiscal year 2017, the Pennsylvania Lottery spent more on advertising ($41.5 million) than it did on education programs and services ($39.8 million).

The majority of Pennsylvanians — 60 percent — believe that the lottery should fund education, while only a quarter think that advertising should be its main priority, according to a February 2018 poll from Franklin & Marshall College.

In light of this, some lawmakers have called for a review of the lottery’s spending priorities.

State Rep. Thomas Murt, R-Philadelphia, has said the lottery is “woefully mismanaged” and that money earmarked for education is instead being used to fund television commercials.

Murt has introduced a bill that would prohibit the lottery from spending more on advertising than on education. The bill has yet to receive a vote in the House of Representatives.

In response to criticism, the Pennsylvania Lottery has said it funds a number of educational initiatives, such as scholarships and school readiness programs.

#  Pennsylvania is one of only six states that doesn't use its lottery revenue to fund education

Pennsylvania is one of only six states that doesn't use its lottery revenue to fund education. In fact, Pennsylvania is the only state in the Northeast that doesn't use its lottery money for education.

Lotteries are intended to help fund government services, but in Pennsylvania, the lottery is used to help fund programs such as hospitals and senior citizens centers.

The lack of funding for education has had a significant impact on Pennsylvania students. In a report released by Education Week in 2016, Pennsylvania was ranked 41st out of 50 states in terms of quality of education.

One reason for this ranking is that Pennsylvania has been forced to make significant cuts to its education budget in recent years. In 2011, the state cut its education budget by $1 billion. These cuts have led to teacher layoffs, larger class sizes, and a reduction in programs and services.

As a result of these budget cuts, many Pennsylvania students are not receiving a quality education. This is particularly true for students who are from low-income families or who are enrolled in charter schools.

In order to improve the quality of education in Pennsylvania, it is important that the state uses its lottery revenue to fund education. This would help to ensure that all students have access to a high-quality education.

#  Pennsylvania's average betting tax rate is the 10th highest in the nation

Pennsylvania's average betting tax rate is the 10th highest in the nation, according to a report from the Tax Foundation.

The Keystone State's average combined state and local tax rate on bets is 9.8 percent, just behind Indiana (10 percent) and Nevada (10.1 percent), and well ahead of the national average of 6.6 percent.

The states with the highest betting taxes are Illinois (16 percent), Louisiana (15 percent), and Missouri (15 percent). The states with the lowest taxes are Oregon (0 percent), Delaware (1.4 percent), and New Hampshire (1.5 percent).

Supporters of higher taxes argue that they can help offset the costs of problem gambling, while opponents say that they will lead to even more people placing bets, thus increasing those costs.

#  Bettors in Pennsylvania lose more money per capita than any other state

According to a report from the Tax Foundation, bettors in Pennsylvania lose more money per capita than any other state in the nation. In total, Pennsylvanians lost an estimated $1.5 billion on sports betting in 2017. This figure is more than twice the amount that was bet in Nevada, which came in second place with $700 million in losses.

The main reason for this high figure is that Pennsylvania has no regulated sports betting industry. This means that all bets must take place through illegal bookmakers, who often charge extremely high fees. As a result, Pennsylvanians are losing out on millions of dollars in potential revenue.

One potential solution to this problem is to legalize and regulate sports betting in the state. This would allow Pennsylvanians to place bets legally and would give the government access to valuable data on sports betting activity. It would also allow the state to collect taxes on gambling revenues, which could be used to fund important programs like education and infrastructure improvements.

Despite these benefits, there is some opposition to legalizing sports betting in Pennsylvania. Some people argue that it could lead to increased crime and addiction rates. However, there is little evidence to support this claim, and it is likely that any such problems could be mitigated through proper regulation.

Ultimately, it is up to the state legislature to decide whether or not to legalize sports betting in Pennsylvania. If they do choose to act, they should make sure to enact a regulatory framework that protects consumers and allows the government to collect taxes on gambling revenues.

#  Pennsylvania has failed to legalize online gambling, costing the state millions in potential revenue

Pennsylvania lawmakers have failed to pass legislation legalizing online gambling, depriving the state of millions in potential revenue, according to a recent report from the state’s Independent Fiscal Office.

The report estimated that the legalization of online gambling could generate up to $180 million in annual revenue for Pennsylvania, but the state legislature has not acted on any such proposals.

This is not the first time that Pennsylvania has missed out on potential revenue from online gambling. In 2013, a similar proposal was put before the state legislature but it was ultimately defeated.

Online gambling is currently legal in New Jersey, Delaware and Nevada, and is estimated to generate more than $1.5 billion in annual revenue nationwide.

Proponents of online gambling argue that it would be a boon for the Pennsylvania economy, creating new jobs and generating much-needed revenue for the state.

However, opponents object to the expansion of gambling in general and believe that it could lead to increased rates of problem gambling.

Despite these objections, there is growing momentum behind online gambling legalization nationwide as states struggle to find new sources of revenue in the age of internet commerce.
