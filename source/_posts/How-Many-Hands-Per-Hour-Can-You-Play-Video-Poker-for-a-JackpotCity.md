#  How Many Hands Per Hour Can You Play Video Poker for a JackpotCity?

Many casino games offer excitement and the potential for winning large sums of money, but few offer the same potential payout as video poker. In fact, video poker has one of the best odds at a casino, which is why it is so popular. But how many hands per hour can you play video poker for a JackpotCity?

The answer to this question depends on a number of factors, including your skill level and the type of video poker game that you are playing. However, on average, most people can play between six and eight hands per hour without making any mistakes. If you are a skilled player and make good decisions, you may be able to play up to twelve hands per hour.

However, it is important to remember that the more hands you play per hour, the higher your chances of making a mistake. This can lead to costly losses, so it is important to play at a pace that you feel comfortable with. Playing fewer hands per hour also allows you to focus on each hand more thoroughly, increasing your chances of winning.

If you are new to video poker, it is advisable to start out by playing just a few hands at a time. This will allow you to get comfortable with the game and learn the basic rules. As you gain experience, you can then increase your playing time gradually until you are comfortable playing up to eight or twelve hands per hour.
