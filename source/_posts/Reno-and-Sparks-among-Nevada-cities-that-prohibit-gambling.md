#  Reno and Sparks among Nevada cities that prohibit gambling

#

Las Vegas may be the gambling capital of the world, but there are a number of other Nevada cities that prohibit gambling. Reno and Sparks are two such cities.

The origins of Reno’s prohibition on gambling date back to the early days of the city. In 1871, the Nevada Territorial Legislature enacted a law that made gambling a felony. The law was aimed at stopping the influx of gamblers who were traveling to Reno in order to take advantage of its lax laws.

Reno’s prohibition on gambling has remained in place ever since. In fact, it was strengthened in 1951, when the Nevada Legislature passed a bill that prohibited gambling within city limits.

Sparks also has a history of prohibiting gambling. The city passed an ordinance banning all forms of gambling in 1938. This ordinance was later superseded by the state law that prohibited gambling within city limits.

#  Reno and Sparks join list of cities in Nevada that prohibit gambling

Reno and Sparks, Nevada, have banned gambling within their jurisdictions. The two cities join Wendover and West Wendover as the only municipalities in Nevada that prohibit all forms of gambling within their borders.

The Reno City Council unanimously passed the ordinance on October 2, 2018. The Sparks City Council did the same on October 3, 2018.

In a statement released by Reno Mayor Hillary Schieve, she said: "This is an important day for Reno. We are sending a clear message that we are a city that values family and morality."

Sparks Mayor Geno Martini added: "As a city we need to be proactive in our approach to protecting our citizens. This ordinance is a step in the right direction."

Reno and Sparks are both located in Washoe County, which is Nevada's second most populous county with 477,510 residents according to the 2016 U.S. Census estimate.

#  Reno, Sparks among latest Nevada cities to prohibit gambling

Las Vegas has held the monopoly on casino gambling in Nevada for many years, but it seems that is starting to change. In the past year a number of smaller cities and towns in Nevada have adopted ordinances prohibiting gambling within their boundaries.

The latest cities to prohibit gambling are Reno and Sparks, both of which are located in Washoe County. The Reno City Council voted unanimously on Tuesday to prohibit any new casinos or card rooms from opening within the city limits. This ordinance will not have any impact on the three existing casinos in Reno, all of which are owned by major gaming companies.

Sparks followed suit on Wednesday by voting unanimously to prohibit any new casinos or card rooms from opening within its city limits. There are currently no casinos or card rooms in Sparks, but that could change if a developer planned to open one there.

These two decisions come less than a year after the city of Fernley passed an ordinance prohibiting any new gambling operations from opening within its city limits. Fernley is located in Lyon County and is just east of Reno.

The reason for this recent trend is unknown, but it could be due to the saturation of the Las Vegas market or the increasing competition from tribal casinos. In any case, it looks like casino gambling is starting to become less popular in Nevada.

#  Reno, Sparks join statewide movement to prohibit gambling

Reno and Sparks on Thursday announced they are backing a statewide ballot measure to outlaw gambling.

The Reno Gazette Journal reports the two cities are the latest to join Carson City, Gardnerville Ranchos and Lyon County in supporting the prohibition measure.

The group is hoping to get the issue on the 2020 ballot.

Gambling is currently allowed in Nevada under state law but is regulated by individual counties.

#  Reno, Sparks lead charge against gambling in Nevada

Reno and Sparks spearheaded the charge against gambling in Nevada. In 1875, Reno was a small town of only about 1000 people. Gambling was legal and thriving. However, Reno’s citizens became increasingly concerned about the social and moral implications of gambling. In 1876, they voted to outlaw all gambling in the city.

The anti-gambling movement quickly spread to Sparks. In 1879, the citizens of Sparks voted to outlaw all gambling in their town. This effectively put an end to legalized gambling in Nevada. It would not be until 1931 that Nevada once again allowed casino gaming.
