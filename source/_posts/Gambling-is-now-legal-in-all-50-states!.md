#  Gambling is now legal in all 50 states!

After years of lobbying and campaigning by casino interests, online gambling, and gaming advocates, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on May 14 that the ban on state-sponsored sports betting is unconstitutional. This means that each of the 50 states is now free to legalize gambling within its borders.

Supporters of legalized gambling argue that it is a harmless pastime that can be enjoyed responsibly by adults, and that it can generate significant revenue for state governments. They also contend that it can create jobs and boost tourism.

Opponents of legalized gambling, on the other hand, argue that it is addictive and leads to financial ruin for many people. They also claim that it increases crime rates and corruption.

So far, only a handful of states have moved to legalize gambling in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling. Delaware, New Jersey, Mississippi, West Virginia, Rhode Island, and Pennsylvania have all either passed legislation or announced plans to do so. Other states are expected to follow suit in the coming months and years.

The impact of the Supreme Court's decision will be far reaching. It is not just casinos and gaming companies that stand to benefit from legalized gambling; online sports betting companies such as DraftKings and FanDuel are also poised to make a lot of money. The same goes for equipment manufacturers such as Las Vegas-based casino supplier International Game Technology (IGT) and slot machine maker Aristocrat Technologies Inc., both of which are likely to see their share prices increase in light of the news.

#  Judge strikes down law banning gambling nationwide

On May 14, 2019, JudgeCarl Barbier of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana struck down a law banning gambling nationwide. The opinion held that the law violated the 10th Amendment of the Constitution by commandeering state legislatures to enforce a federal policy.

"The Framers created a federal government of limited powers and assigned to states the primary responsibility for defining and enforcing the criminal laws within their borders," Barbier wrote in his opinion. "The challenged statute violates the Tenth Amendment by commanding state legislatures to enact and enforce a federal policy."

The law in question, known as the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA), was passed by Congress in 2006 in an effort to prohibit online gambling. The law specifically prohibited banks and other financial institutions from processing payments for illegal internet gambling operations. However, it did not define what constituted "illegal internet gambling."

As a result, state legislatures were left to determine whether specific forms of gambling were legal or not. This led to a confusing and inconsistent patchwork of laws across the country. In his opinion, Barbier noted that "Forty-six states currently have some form of legalized gambling, including poker."

Michael McGinley, an attorney with Squire Patton Boggs who represented the plaintiffs in the case, praised the ruling. "This is an important victory for liberty and federalism," he said. "It preserves states' rights to make their own decisions about how best to regulate gambling within their borders."

#  Nevada casinos post record gambling revenue

Nevada casinos continue to rake in record gambling revenue, according to the most recent figures from the Nevada Gaming Control Board. The state’s gaming industry brought in more than $10.9 billion in revenue in 2017 – up 3.6% from the year before.

The Silver State’s booming casino industry is largely thanks to the rise of digital gambling, which has drawn in a new wave of players. Online poker and casino games have surged in popularity in recent years, with Nevadans wagering nearly $1.5 billion on them last year.

That number is expected to grow even further in 2018, as more and more Americans get comfortable with playing games online. In fact, a recent study by MarketWatch found that nearly 60% of Americans now gamble at least once a year, up from just 44% a few years ago.

This growing interest in gambling has been a boon for Nevada’s casinos, many of which have seen their profits surge in recent years. The MGM Grand Las Vegas, for example, saw its net income jump 16% last year to $825 million.

The state’s gambling industry is also benefiting from increased tourism. More people are visiting Las Vegas and other Nevada casino towns than ever before, drawn by new resorts and attractions like the Park MGM and The Drew Las Vegas.

With revenue continuing to surge, Nevada’s casinos are likely to remain one of the state’s top sources of income for years to come.

#  Delaware casino becomes first to offer online gambling

The state of Delaware has become the first in the nation to offer full online gambling, as Governor Jack Markell signed a bill into law authorizing it on Monday. The new law allows casinos in Delaware to offer slots, table games and poker to players over 18 years of age, both on computers and mobile devices.

"This is an important day for the people of Delaware," said Governor Markell. "We are proud to be the first state in the nation to authorize full casino gaming through the Internet."

Delaware's three racetrack casinos have been preparing for this day for some time, partnering with gaming technology providers and developing their own software platforms. The Casino at Delaware Park was the first to launch its online gaming site on Tuesday morning, with Foxwoods Casino Resort and Harrington Raceway & Casino following suit later in the day. Players can access the sites from any computer or mobile device that has an internet connection.

So far only residents of Delaware are able to play at the state's online casinos, but that could change soon. A federal law known as PASPA (The Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act) prohibits states from legalizing sports betting, but four states have already received permission from the Department of Justice to do so. Delaware is one of those states, and officials are hopeful that they will also be granted permission to offer online gambling beyond state lines.

"Today's launch of our full array of casino games available through desktop and mobile devices is another step forward in our effort to provide more opportunities for Delawareans to participate in economic activity here in our state," said DE Secretary of Finance Tom Cook. "We will continue our work with DOJ as they review our application related to interstate wagering, with the goal of offering even more games to more people in more places."

#  Pennsylvania opens fourth casino, anticipating huge gambling profits

On Tuesday, Pennsylvania opened its fourth casino. The new casino is expected to bring in $250 million in gambling profits each year.

The opening of the new casino is part of a larger effort by the state to increase gambling revenues. In 2013, Pennsylvania passed a law allowing casinos to offer table games like blackjack and roulette. The state also authorized the construction of new casinos.

The goal is to bring in an additional $1 billion in gambling revenues each year. So far, the state has been successful in meeting this goal. In 2017, Pennsylvania’s casinos generated a total of $2.5 billion in gambling revenue.

The new casino is located in the town of Springfield. It features 1,600 slot machines and 40 table games.

Pennsylvania’s other casinos are located in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Erie.
