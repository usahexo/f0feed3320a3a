#  Lumiere Casino Beats the Odds with Blackjack Payouts

The Lumiere Casino was founded in St. Louis, Missouri in November 2014. The casino is locally owned and operated and offers a gaming experience that is unique to the region. One of the popular attractions at the casino is blackjack.

Blackjack is a game that involves betting against the house on the outcome of a card hand. The goal is to draw cards that total 21 or come as close as possible without going over. If the player busts (goes over 21), they lose regardless of the dealer’s hand.

The key to blackjack success is knowing when to hit and when to stand. This depends on the cards in your hand and the dealer’s upcard. For instance, if you have a six and an eight, you would normally hit because the best you can hope for with those two cards is 14 (not counting face cards). If the dealer has a two showing, however, you would want to stand because it gives you the best chance of winning (assuming they don’t pull another two).

At Lumiere Casino, players are paid 3-2 on blackjack hands consisting of an Ace and any other card valued at 10 points. So, for example, if you are dealt an Ace and King of Spades as your first two cards, you would be paid $7 ($5 wagered plus $2 winnings) rather than $5 ($5 wagered). This higher payout makes blackjack one of the most lucrative games at the casino.

In addition to 3-2 payouts on blackjacks, Lumiere Casino also offers other generous bonuses on table games including:

• 100% match bonus up to $1,000 on your first deposit

• 50% match bonus up to $500 on your second deposit

• 25% match bonus up to $250 on your third deposit

So whether you’re a seasoned blackjack player or just looking to try your hand at this popular casino game, Lumiere Casino has something for everyone!

#  Casino Pays Out $10,000 on Blackjack Win

Tom, a regular at the casino, was enjoying his usual blackjack game when he hit a lucky streak. With an ace and a six, he bet $10 on his next hand and won. Excited, he doubled his bet for the next hand, and won again. He did this two more times, and then hit a blackjack on his final hand.

Normally, the casino would only pay out 6:5 on blackjack wins, but because Tom was so lucky that night, the casino paid him out at 3:2 odds. This meant that Tom walked away with $10,000 in winnings!

Although winning streaks like this don't happen often, they can definitely happen. So if you're feeling lucky one night at the casino, don't be afraid to put a bit more money on the table. You may just end up walking away a lot richer!
